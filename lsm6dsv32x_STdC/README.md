# LSM6DSV32X

The LSM6DSV32X is a high-performance, low-power 6-axis small IMU, featuring a 3-axis digital accelerometer at 32 g and a 3-axis digital gyroscope, that offers the best IMU sensor with a triple-channel architecture for processing acceleration and angular rate data on three separate channels (user interface, OIS, and EIS) with dedicated configuration, processing, and filtering.

The device enables processes in edge computing, leveraging embedded advanced dedicated features such as a finite state machine (FSM) for configurable motion tracking and a machine learning core (MLC) for context awareness with exportable AI features for IoT applications.

The LSM6DSV32X supports the adaptive self-configuration (ASC) feature, which allows the FSM to automatically reconfigure the device in real time based on the detection of a specific motion pattern or based on the output of a specific decision tree configured in the MLC, without any intervention from the host processor.

The device embeds Qvar (electric charge variation detection) for user interface functions like tap, double tap, triple tap, long press, or L/R â€“ R/L swipe.

The LSM6DSV32X embeds an analog hub able to connect an external analog input and convert it to a digital signal for processing.
